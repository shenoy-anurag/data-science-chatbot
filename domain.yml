          payload: "/explain_generative_chatbot"

  utter_explain_retrieval_chatbot:
    - text: "Retrieval based chatbots have pre-defined actions/responses to questions that the user might ask. They are trained to recognize the user's intent and then respond according to their instructions. I am a retrieval based chatbot. If you ask me something I can't answer, I cannot give a satisfactory reply like generative chatbots can. However, I can deeply integrate with businesses and their tools. So in a bank's bot, you can check your account balance."

  utter_explain_generative_chatbot:
    - text: "Generative chatbots don't have any predefined actions/responses and instead are trained on a language model that predicts a response to the input sentence. So a generative bot will generate the response on-the-fly and seem much smarter. However, since they aren't trained to perform actions/run code upon certain inputs, they cannot integrate with APIs or businesses. Check out a generative chatbot here: https://www.cleverbot.com/"

  utter_explain_deep_learning:
    - text: "Deep learning is a subset of Machine Learning where we use neural networks having 3 or more layers. Neural networks train on unstructured data and modify weights and biases of the neurons in the layers to fit the training data. Neural networks are better able to generalise on large amounts of unstructured data such as images, audio and video."

  utter_why_machine_learning:
    - text: "Writing rules to manage the trees (branching of conversations) and writing code to perform appropriate actions become more and more difficult as your chatbot grows is size and scope. Using machine learning can leverage the power of data and make predictions to handle the edge cases that you may not have though of gracefully. And remember, the more training data you have, the better!"

  utter_explain_nlp:
    - text: "Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software.

  utter_explain_dialogue_machines:
    - text: "Dialogue Machines are tools which can use the NLP data to help direct the conversation in a smooth and effective manner. It helps you train a model that predicts what actions the bot should take given a set of circumstances (the conversation had so far). Dialogue Flow (https://dialogflow.com/), Wit.Ai (https://wit.ai/) and Rasa (https://rasa.com/) are some of the most popular dialogue machines out there."

  utter_explain_intents:
    - text: "When you ask me a question, I have to understand what you are trying to say or do. This understanding is called intent. Intents are as the English word definition mentions: the intention (purpose)/end goal/aim of the user to do something. "

  utter_explain_entities:
    - text: "When you ask me a question, like \"What's the weather like in India\" -- It is always HOT and HUMID btw. I need to be able to not only know the intent, but also the key pieces of information you have provided. In this case, it is \"India\". This ability to recognize data in the chat message is known as Named Entity Recognition (NER)"
